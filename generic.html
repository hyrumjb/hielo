					<p>A country of roughly 16.6 million people as per 2024 census,[15] Zimbabwe's largest ethnic group 
						are the Shona, who make up 80% of the population, followed by the Northern Ndebele and other 
						smaller minorities. Zimbabwe has 16 official languages,[3] with English, Shona, and Ndebele the 
						most common. Zimbabwe is a member of the United Nations, the Southern African Development 
						Community, the African Union, and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa.</p>

					<p>Beginning in the 9th century, during its late Iron Age, the Bantu people (who would become the 
						ethnic Shona) built the city-state of Great Zimbabwe; the city-state became one of the major 
						African trade centres by the 11th century but was abandoned by the mid 15th century.[16] From 
						there, the Kingdom of Zimbabwe was established, followed by the Rozvi and Mutapa empires. The 
						British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes demarcated the Rhodesia region in 1890 when they 
						conquered Mashonaland and later in 1893 Matabeleland after the First Matabele War. Company rule 
						ended in 1923 with the establishment of Southern Rhodesia as a self-governing British colony. In 
						1965, the white minority government unilaterally declared independence as Rhodesia. The state 
						endured international isolation and a 15-year guerrilla war with black nationalist forces; this 
						culminated in a peace agreement that established de jure sovereignty as Zimbabwe in April 1980.</p>

					<p>Robert Mugabe became Prime Minister of Zimbabwe in 1980, when his ZANUPF party won the general 
						election following the end of white minority rule and has remained the country's dominant party 
						since. He was the President of Zimbabwe from 1987, after converting the country's initial parliamentary 
						system into a presidential one, until his resignation in 2017. Under Mugabe's authoritarian regime, the 
						state security apparatus dominated the country and was responsible for widespread human rights 
						violations.[17] From 1997 to 2008 the economy experienced consistent decline (and in the latter years, 
						hyperinflation), though it has since seen rapid growth after the use of currencies other than the 
						Zimbabwean dollar was permitted. In 2017, in the wake of over a year of protests against his government 
						as well as Zimbabwe's rapidly declining economy, a coup d'Ã©tat resulted in Mugabe's resignation. 
						Emmerson Mnangagwa has since served as Zimbabwe's president.</p>
